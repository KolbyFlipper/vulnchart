The initial intentions of this repository are to serve as a basic web app that ingests numbers to produce a nice graphic and dashboard. 

The eventual goals of this repository are to also serve as a testing ground wherein I can create vulnerabilities to experiment with testing them as an attacker.
Additionally, it will serve as a testing dummy for code-scanning tools to validate their functionality, and be able to compare and contrast the efficacy of various tools.

Current state: Barely Functional. It connects to a mongodb server. That is it. 

Next steps: 
Data ingestion via a React component
Data storage in Mongo
Visual dashboard page for vulnerability statistics
Add vulnerabilities in to the data ingestion piece- SQL injection ? 
Add additional vulnerable functionality. 
Add a separate folder with samples of insecure code.
